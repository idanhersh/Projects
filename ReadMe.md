Final Project
-------------
Introduction
------------
In our project we were looking to find a model to fit, our data on at-risk youth. 
We tried to find a connection between different traumatic events and high education level,
and how different types of support can influence the level of education recieved by the child.

Requirements
------------
In order to use our rmd and replicate our analysis, you need to import two datasets of the two different surveys conducted on the at-risk youth.
Make sure all the imports at the beginning of the code are installed.
Inside the rmd code file, there is a line with a hyperlink to a file, make sure you change this link to the location the data set is saved on your computer.

Run the code!
